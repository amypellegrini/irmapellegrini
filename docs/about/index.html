            Irma started making her first wood carvings at the beginning of the
            '80s in Argentina when looking for a way of expression. Developing
            different techniques of her own, she made progress in the knowledge
            of the wood and how to work with it, whilst facing more and more
            exigent<br />
            aesthetic objectives.

          <p>
            In 1987 she started being known in the city of Neuquen, where she
            made the first exhibition of her pictures at a shop in the centre.
            Given the impact of the exhibition and the demands from the public
            she started to teach children and adults the fruit of her experience
            in those introspection years. As a consequence, her techniques were
            diffused in a direct and indirect way, because some of her disciples
            are still teaching them at schools and workshops.
          </p>

          <p>
            Irma showed and sold her works in the Artisans' Fairs of Neuquen
            –where she got involved in creating the Artisans' Centre–, Las
            Grutas and others.
          </p>

          <p>
            In her pictures she uses only wood's natural colour and grains. She
            achieves this from rests of sawmills, the forest ground, the lakes
            and streams banks.
          </p>

          <p>
            In 1993 Irma showed at the XI Cordoba's International Handicrafts
            Fair, where she obtained the 1st Prize in the carved wood category
            and two special mentions.
          </p>

          <p>
            Her production goes from pictures to everyday objects: bread
            baskets, sewing baskets, trays, boxes, photo frames, among others.
            She lately focused on the production of pictures with different
            carving techniques and collages and in 1995 she presented her works
            in Pinamar (Buenos Aires province), where a permanent exhibition
            remains at the Carilo Tennis Ranch.
          </p>

          <p>
            In 1997 she participated at La Feria del Sol through LORIEN, which
            takes place once a year at the Palais de Glace, in the city of
            Buenos Aires's, and in the Fine Art Museum's Friends Society.
          </p>

          <p>
            In 2001 Irma introduced her work in the UK, exhibiting at Camden
            Lock, Green Park, Chelsea, Highgate, the Red Ban Gallery of Kings
            Lynn, and, in 2007, the Greenwich Artists Collective.
          </p>

          <p>Irma is currently working on a new show coming soon.</p>
